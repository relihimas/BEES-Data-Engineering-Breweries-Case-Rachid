The goal of this test is to assess your skills in consuming data from an API, transforming and persisting it into a data lake following the medallion architecture with three layers: raw data, curated data partitioned by location, and an analytical aggregated layer.

# 📊 Project Status

- Status: Active
- Maintenance: Actively maintained by Rachid Elihimas
- Dataset Size: 9,000+ breweries

# 🔧 Requirements

- Linux

# Features
- Breweries Data: Using the Open Brewery DB API to fetch data, listing breweries companies: [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).
- Docker: Using Docker Composo with other Dockerfiles for support.
- Orchestration: This project will use Airflow v3.1.3.
- Database: Postgres SQL (already provided by Airflow)
- Programming Language: Python (with PySpark)
- DataLake Architecture: Medallion Architecture.
- Monitoring/Alerts: 

## Breweries Data:

1. Main Goal:
   - Fetch Data from the [API List Breweries](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation#list-breweries)

2. Logic:

   - The code will extract from the MetaData API the total amount of Breweries;
   - The code will use this total amount of Breweries as variable to determinate the amount of pages for the API List Breweries;
   - The code will run the API List Breweries and extract from each page a total of 200 Breweries;
   - The code will save the list as a JSON file with it's generated metadata for the following purposes:
     - Retention and recovery > Can easily reprocess from the original source without relying on the external system.
     - Traceability  > Storing raw data supports traceability and regulatory compliance (LGPD). 
     - Imutability > Unaltered state of the data, ensuring you always have an immutable snapshot for reference.
     - Easy for reprocessing > Can restart the downstream transformation without new API calls.
     - Source decoupling > Reduces depency on external APIs or system, avoiding downtimes.
     - Schema evolution > Keep the original data to adapt in any case of Bronze schema changes.
     - Quality > enables comparison between raw and processed data.
      
3. Data Schema:

   Each brewery entry contains the following fields:
   
    ```json
    {
        "id": "5128df48-79fc-4f0f-8b52-d06be54d0cec",
        "name": "(405) Brewing Co",
        "brewery_type": "micro",
        "address_1": "1716 Topeka St",
        "address_2": null,
        "address_3": null,
        "city": "Norman",
        "state_province": "Oklahoma",
        "postal_code": "73069-8224",
        "country": "United States",
        "longitude": -97.46818222,
        "latitude": 35.25738891,
        "phone": "4058160490",
        "website_url": "http://www.405brewing.com",
        "state": "Oklahoma",
        "street": "1716 Topeka St"
    }
   ```
    Also, we can use the Query Parameters available on the Docs

4. Meta Data:

    For best practice the code will add the following fields:

   ```json
   {
      "file_name": "bees_listbreweries_20251127_145352.json",
      "total_amount_breweries": 9.038,
      "source_endpoint": "https://api.openbrewerydb.org/v1/breweries",
      "source_query": "page=46&per_page=200",
      "creation_timestamp": "20251127 14:53:52",
      "batch_id": "8b52-d06be5",
      "bronze_target": "breweries_bronze",
      "body": [{}]
   }
   ```
